One fine morning, Two Friends, Rock and Kevin were roaming in the jungles of Jumanji.
They are enjoying the scenery and the wide range of flora and fauna that jungles of Jumanji has.
Suddenly there was a sound that startled them. The sound appears to be the sound of a bear growling.
Both of them started panicking and started looking everywhere for the signs of a bear.
And there it is, a big black bear, coming towards them.
The bear saw them and they started running.
The bear started following them.
Kevin who knows how to climb trees, immediately climbed one of the nearby trees.
Rock who doesnt know how to climb trees, looked up for the help of his friend. But the bear caught up to them.
So Rock ended up acting dead. The bear came near Rock and sniffed him and it left after whispering something in his ears.
as soon as the bear left, Kevin climbed down and asked Rock if he is okay and asked what was the bear whispering?
Rock said that the bear told a proverb
Kevin, who is very eager to know what the proverb is, asked Rock about it.
Rock replied, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
